Todays Session on Interfaces

Interface is defined as an abstract type that defines methods a class must implement. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in java
To implement an interface, "implements" is used as a key word

A class can extend another class. An interface can extend another interface.
A class can implement an interface but an interface cannot implement a class.


Use a class when:
1. You need to represent a real world entitiy with attributes and behaviors (methods)
2. You need to create objects that hold state
3. Classes are blueprints for objects

Use an Interface when:
1. You need to define a contract for behavior that multiple classes implement
2. Ideal for achieve abstration and multiple inheritance
